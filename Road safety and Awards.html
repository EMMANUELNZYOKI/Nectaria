		<p>Road traffic injuries are a major public health issue, with approximately 1.35 million people dying annually due to road traffic crashes. 
		Additionally, between 20 to 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries, often resulting in long-term disabilities that significantly impact their quality of life. 
		Economically, road traffic crashes cost most countries about 3% of their gross domestic product, 
		making road safety not only a public health concern but also an economic one.</p>
		<p>
			<em>Several risk factors contribute to the high incidence of road traffic accidents worldwide. 
				Speeding is a primary cause, as higher speeds increase both the likelihood and severity of crashes.
				Driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs significantly impairs driving skills, leading to accidents. 
				Distracted driving, often due to mobile phone usage, is another major factor. Furthermore,
				the failure to use seat belts and helmets increases the risk of death and injury during crashes. 
				Poor vehicle safety standards and poorly designed or maintained road infrastructure also play significant roles in road traffic accidents.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			    Effective road safety interventions are essential to mitigate these risks. 
				Implementing and enforcing strong legislation on speeding, seat belts, drink-driving, and helmet use has proven effective.
				Improving road design, such as adding safe pedestrian crossings and traffic calming measures, enhances safety for all road users.
				Adoption of international vehicle safety standards can significantly reduce vehicle-related risks. Public awareness campaigns educate the populace on safe driving practices and potential risks. 
				Additionally, having an effective post-crash care system ensures that those injured in accidents receive timely and adequate medical attention, 
				thereby reducing fatalities and long-term disabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Future directions for road safety in Kenya include strengthening the enforcement of traffic laws and penalties to ensure compliance.
			Technological integration, such as the use of speed cameras and automated traffic management systems, can enhance enforcement efforts.
			Engaging local communities in road safety advocacy can promote safer behaviors. International collaboration can help Kenya leverage global best practices and support from international road safety programs.
			Finally, promoting sustainable transport solutions, such as safer public transport systems and non-motorized transport options, can contribute to overall road safety improvements.
