	<h2 class="author-bio">Introduction

		The industrial attachment exercise is a vital part of higher education, especially in Kenya. It provides students with a real-world organizational environment to develop essential skills for their professional growth. Our unique Industrial Attachment Program helps students discover and advance their careers through well-structured, credit-bearing employment experiences, combining theory with practice. The program includes professional training from start to finish, allowing students to apply academic skills in relevant industries and gain insights into their operations.

We recognize the importance of exploring career interests, learning new skills, gaining job-related experience, building professional networks, and understanding workplace expectations. Students are expected to apply their school knowledge and develop their competencies during the attachment.

In response to increased demand, we have established a dedicated department to coordinate the program, ensuring personalized attention to all participants. Currently, we accept students in the following courses:

Accounting & Finance
Procurement & Logistics
Statistics & ICT-based Courses
Mass Media, Journalism, PR & Applied Communication
Hospitality Courses</h2>
